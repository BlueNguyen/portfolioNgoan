Just change `src/portfolio.js` to get your personal portfolio. Customize portfolio theme by using your own color scheme globally in the  `src/_globalColor.scss` file. Feel free to use it as-is or personalize it as much as you want.

If you'd like to **contribute** and make this much better for other users, have a look at [Issues](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio/issues).

Created something awesome for your fork of the portfolio and want to share it? Feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio/pulls).

## Getting Started

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```
### Docker Commands

```


## How To Use

#### Resume upload
To upload your own resume, simply upload a pdf to `src/containers/greeting/resume` and rename the pdf to `resume.pdf`. 

#### Customize Lottie Animations

You can choose a Lottie and download it in json format from sites like [this](https://lottiefiles.com/). In `src/assets/lottie`, replace the Lottie json file you want to alter with the same file name. If you want to change the Lottie options, go to `src/components/displayLottie/DisplayLottie.js` and change the `defaultOptions` object, you can refer [lottie-react docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react) for more info on the `defaultOptions` object.
